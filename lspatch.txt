autostart   -- auto execute some scripts or applications once dwm start
vanitygaps  -- like i3-gaps, but dwm
fullscreen  -- fullscreen one window
noborder    -- do not show border
viewontag   -- follow a window to the tag it is being moved to
hide-vacant-tags -- hide any tag if it has no window
awesomebar  -- shows all tasks in the current tag in the taskbar at all times
status2d    -- allows colors and rectangle drawing in your DWM status bar
tatami      -- another layout
dwmc        -- allow us change dwm source code and take effect immediately

These two conflict with each other:
systray     -- for application deamon icon display
alpha       -- make transparent for status bar
